## Key Insights

### Player Performance Trends

- Shubman Gill has been India's most consistent batter since 2020, with an average of 59.63 and notable improvement in his post-powerplay scoring rate.
- Virat Kohli continues to anchor the middle overs effectively, balancing strike rotation with selective boundary-hitting.
- Rohit Sharma provides strong starts but shows lower conversion from 50+ scores in recent years.
- Shreyas Iyer has improved significantly against short-pitched deliveries and has shown strong performance against spin, particularly left-arm spin.

### Venue-Based Findings – Dubai Focus

- Dubai pitches tend to slow down as matches progress. Strike rotation becomes essential, especially during overs 10–40.
- Spin bowlers and slower deliveries are more effective in containing runs and breaking partnerships in Dubai.
- Teams chasing have a higher win rate in day-night matches, especially due to dew and pitch settling.
- A minimum target of 280 is recommended when batting first to exert scoreboard pressure.

### Tactical Recommendations

- Focus on stable yet aggressive starts during the powerplay to build momentum.
- Utilize wrist spinners and slow bowlers in middle overs to apply pressure and control run flow.
- Prioritize finishers with proven death-over efficiency; bowlers should focus on variations.
- Strategic role clarity is needed for the middle order to improve strike rotation and minimize collapses.
